# stable-diffusion_1111
Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022 based on diffusion techniques. It is considered to be a part of the ongoing AI boom.

It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt. Its development involved researchers from the CompVis Group at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Runway with a computational donation from the authors and training data from non-profit organizations.

It requires at least 4GB of dedicated GPU, un fortunatly i have only 2GB on my pc hence was not able to run it on my pc locally, when i tried my pc stops, hangs or does not respond. Running it on colab is quite an possibility but with current changes that goggle made with the notebook it hass banned the use of Heavy ai model in their free runtime hence the model runs only for few minutes and then stops, to runn the model it is recommended to run it on colab pro.
